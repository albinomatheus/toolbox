#' Create the historical birth cohorts for a census.
#' @description The birth cohorts for a census represent the population born during a set interval
#' of time. The date assigned to the time interval is the midpoint of the interval.
#' This is generalized from the PAS spreadsheet called GRPOP-YB.

#' @param Value numeric. A vector of demographic population counts by age.
#' @param Age integer. A vector of ages corresponding to the lower integer bound of the counts.
#' @param CensusDate date . The date of the first census. See details for ways to express it.
#' @param cohortSize integer. The length of time (years) surrounding each output birth cohort. Default 5.

#' @details Age groups must be of equal intervals. No specific age structure is assumed for the census. Births
#' are assumed to happen uniformly over the cohorts' intervals. The final age group is assumed to be the same
#' size as all the other age groups. If \code{cohortSize} does not divide evenly into the largest age in the data,
#' any additional (higher) ages needed are set as zero. For example, if cohortSize is 7 and the largest age is 90,
#' then age 91 (necessary for the matrix sum) is set as zero. Dates can be given in three ways 1) a \code{Date} class object,
#'  2) an unambiguous character string in the format \code{"YYYY-MM-DD"},
#' or 3) as a decimal date consisting in the year plus the fraction of the year passed as of the given date.

#' @return A data frame with a decimal date corresponding to the midpoint of the birth cohort and resulting population counts.
